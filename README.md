# My Personal Project

## A spending tracker

My project will be an application for tracking the user's
spending. Set a budget for the week or month, log 
the amount and category of each transaction you make, track
how far under or over your budget you are. Statistics on
your spending history and how it differs between weeks
and months will be available. Possible features include
graphs to visualize your spending over time. It will be aimed more at tracking the kind of small
purchases that add up, like a coffee every other day
or an Amazon order, rather than big payments like
tuition and rent.

Anyone who is looking to cut down on small unnecessary
purchases will use the application. It is of interest
to me largely because I'm curious to see what results
I would get from using something like it. Of course
I can just look at my bank statement if I want to see
my purchase history, but I hope to make an application
that makes the user reflect on their spending a bit more
than one normally would.

## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a purchase to my history
- As a user, I want to be able to specify the category of a purchase
- As a user, I want to be able to set a budget for a certain time period
- As a user, I want to be able to see how my spending has changed over time
- As a user, I want to be able to save my budget and purchases made to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my budget and purchases made from file
